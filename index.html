					<p>
						We present our Multi-Armed Bandit EvaLuator (MABEL) that
						evaluates several Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) models for
						real-world efficacy. This is the first known tool of its
						kind that can evaluate several MAB models, evaluating
						their ability to deal with corrupt and missing values.
						We also present a robust evaluation of several
						Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) and Contextual Multi-Armed
						Bandit (MAB) models.
					</p>
					<p>
						The MABEL tool uses a real-world scenario of autonomous
						connected vehicles (ACVs). These ACVs rely on sensors
						and inter-vehicle communication to operate safely and
						effectively as a fleet. This interconnectedness exposes
						the ACV system to cyber attacks in which an attacker
						injecting or manipulating sensor readings for even one
						vehicle could disrupt the entire ACV system. One
						approach to filtering out compromised sensor reading is
						with the use of MAB and CMAB machine learning models to
						assign penalties from a Gaussian distribution to the
						ACVs for crashes which often result from trusting data
						outliers. We researched algorithms that could be
						applicable and began with Epsilon-greedy, Linear
						Thompson Sampling, and LinUCB (Upper Confidence Bound).
						To fairly compare the models while handling the
						different input requirement, we created the ACV robust
						simulation MABEL using a MAPE-K adaptation control loop
						to run 100s of trials. We present our findings applying
						various MAB/CMAB models to MABEL to serve as a benchmark
						determining which model would be best suited for sensor
						outlier identification. The MAB/CMAB algorithm
						implementations and MABEL will both be presented as well
						as the findings from the evaluation itself.
					</p>
					<p>
						The findings suggest that while not all MAB algorithms
						are suited to address the scenario we presented, some
						models such as LinUCB demonstrate notable success in
						filtering out compromised sensor readings in ACV
						systems.

					<p>
						MABEL is open source and can be access at
						<a
							href="https://github.com/iCMAB/iCMAB-SimulationTool/tree/main"
							>MABEL Github.</a
						>
					</p>
					<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Clone
							<pre>
git clone https://github.com/iCMAB/iCMAB-SimulationTool.git</pre
							>
						</li>
						<li>
							Run
							<pre>python3 src/ACVSimulation.py</pre>
						</li>
						<li>
							The MABEL interface will guide you in the section of
							an MAB or CMAB model and results will display in the
							terminal.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<h2 id="output">Output</h2>
					<p>
						When running MABEL, output will be broken up into four
						discrete sections:
					</p>
					<h3>1. Model Selection</h3>
					<img src="select-model.png" /><br />
					<p>
						The MABEL interface will prompt you to select from a
						list of MAB models to test.
					</p>
					<h3>2. Starting Information</h3>
					<img src="starting-info.png" /><br />
					<p>
						Once a model is selected, some starting information will
						be provided:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<b>MAB model:</b> the MAB model that was selected.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>ACV count:</b> the number of ACVs that are in the
							simulation.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Ideal distance:</b> the distance which the ACVs
							will try to maintain between each other.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Total iterations:</b> the number of iterations
							the simulation will run for.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Iterations being modified:</b> the iterations
							where distance sensor readings will be manipulated.
							Displays the iterations which the modification will
							occur, the ACV which will be modified, and the
							multiplier that will be applied to the distance
							sensor value
						</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>3. Simulation</h3>
					<img
						src="acv-table.png"
						style="width: 100%; max-width: 900px"
					/><br />
					<p>
						The simulation is visualized as a table showing the
						distance, speed, location values of each ACV in the
						system. Note that the lead ACV does not have a distance
						value as there are no ACVs ahead of it.
					</p>
					<p>The color coding of the table is as follows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p
								style="
									background-color: yellow;
									display: inline;
								"
							>
								Yellow:
							</p>
							The ACV's distance sensor has been manipulated. A
							short description of this is also displayed to the
							right of the table.
						</li>
						<li>
							<p
								style="
									background-color: red;
									color: white;
									display: inline;
								"
							>
								Red:
							</p>
							A crash has occurred between two ACVs. A short
							description of this is displayed to the right of the
							table as well.
						</li>
						<li>
							<p
								style="
									background-color: lightgreen;
									display: inline;
								"
							>
								Green:
							</p>
							The MAB model has determined that the reading is
							faulty and the ACV has decided to ignore the sensor
							reading. The actual, unmodified distance reading is
							given in its place.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>4. Metrics</h3>
					<img
						src="final-stats.png"
						style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px"
					/><br />
					<p>
						Various metrics are shown at the conclusion of the
						simulation.
					</p>
					<p>
						The table describes the penalty and regret incurred by
						each ACV, compared with what the baseline of these
						values would be (no sensor reading filtering applied).
						Below the table is the total number of crashes, average
						penalty and total regret for all ACVs, along with their
						baseline values, and percentage improvement in penalty
						and regret compared to the baseline.
					</p>
					<p>Some notes about penalty and regret:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Penalty:</b> penalty (P) = variation (V) from
							desired ^2 -> P = V^2. This is essentially the
							distance from the desired distance squared. When
							vehicles collide, a very large penalty of 1000 is
							applied to the ACV so long as there was a choice it
							could've made that would've prevented the crash
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Regret:</b> regret is calculated by subtracting
							the baseline penalty from the actual penalty.
							Essentially, it is the difference between the
							achieved utlity and what it would've been without
							any bad sensor filtering applied.
						</li>
					</ul>
